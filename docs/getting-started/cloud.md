# Getting Started with Dragonfly Cloud

Dragonfly Cloud is an in-memory data store service fully managed by the Dragonfly team.
It is the easiest way to run Dragonfly in production with minimal operational overhead.
You can provision your Dragonfly Cloud instances on AWS, GCP, or Azure and connect via VPC or public network.

Follow the [Dragonfly Cloud documentation](/docs/cloud/getting-started.md) to get started
and have a data store ready to use in the cloud within 5 minutes.
