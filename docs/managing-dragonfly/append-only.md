# Append Only Mode (AOF)

At this time, Dragonfly does not support Append Only Mode (AOF). The primary reason is that it has not been a high priority request in the community. The AOF mode in Dragonfly will require a different approach than in Redis and is more complicated to implement, however, it is something we are considering for future versions. Please join the discussion on the [Dragonfly Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HsPjXGVH85) if you have any thoughts or suggestions on this topic.
