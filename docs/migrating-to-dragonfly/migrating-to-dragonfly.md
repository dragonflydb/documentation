# Migration Overview

## Introduction

Migrating your existing applications from Redis to Dragonfly is a pivotal step in harnessing the power of our advanced database solution.
While migration might seem challenging at first glance, our comprehensive set of migration techniques, detailed in this section, aims to simplify the process for various scenarios.

## Navigating the Migration Landscape

Embarking on the migration journey from Redis to Dragonfly requires careful consideration and planning.
Our goal is to make this transition as smooth as possible, ensuring that your applications experience minimal disruption during the process.

## Unveiling the Migration Techniques

Within this section, we present a diverse range of migration techniques designed to accommodate different requirements.
Whether your priority is to minimize downtime or ease process, we have tailored approaches to suit your specific needs.

- **Balancing Downtime and Simplicity:** Some of our migration techniques necessitate a brief downtime window, albeit accompanied by straightforward setup and execution steps.
These approaches enable you to swiftly migrate your Redis-based applications to Dragonfly with minimal hassle.

- **Navigating Complexity for Zero Downtime:** In scenarios where downtime is not an option, we offer advanced techniques that demand a deeper understanding of both Redis and Dragonfly.
These methods, while more intricate, empower you to migrate without interrupting your application's availability.

## Choosing Your Migration Path

Selecting the right migration technique is pivotal to achieving a successful transition.
Assess your application's requirements, current infrastructure, and tolerance for downtime when deciding which approach aligns best with your objectives.

When migrating from a Redis instance:

- [Snapshot and Restore](./01-from-redis-instance/00-snapshot-and-restore.md) presents the simplest entry point.
- Dive into the [Replication](./01-from-redis-instance/01-replication.md) technique for enhanced data consistency and reduced downtime.
- For a more intricate configuration offering minimal to no downtime, explore the [Sentinel Promotion](./01-from-redis-instance/02-sentinel-promotion.md) technique.
