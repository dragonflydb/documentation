Renames `key` to `newkey` if `newkey` does not yet exist.
It returns an error when `key` does not exist.

* `1` if `key` was renamed to `newkey`.
* `0` if `newkey` already exists.

## Examples

dragonfly> SET mykey "Hello"
"OK"
dragonfly> SET myotherkey "World"
"OK"
dragonfly> RENAMENX mykey myotherkey
(integer) 0
dragonfly> GET myotherkey
"World"
```
