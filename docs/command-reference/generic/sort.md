# SORT

## Syntax

    SORT key [LIMIT offset count] [ASC | DESC] [ALPHA]

**Time complexity:** O(N+M*log(M)) where N is the number of elements in the list or set to sort, and M the number of returned elements. When the elements are not sorted, complexity is O(N).

**ACL categories:** @write, @set, @sortedset, @list, @slow, @dangerous

Returns or stores the elements contained in the [list][tdtl], [set][tdts] or
[sorted set][tdtss] at `key`.

By default, sorting is numeric and elements are compared by their value
interpreted as double precision floating point number.
This is `SORT` in its simplest form:

[tdtl]: https://redis.io/topics/data-types#lists
[tdts]: https://redis.io/topics/data-types#set
[tdtss]: https://redis.io/topics/data-types#sorted-sets

```
SORT mylist
```

Assuming `mylist` is a list of numbers, this command will return the same list
with the elements sorted from small to large.
In order to sort the numbers from large to small, use the `!DESC` modifier:

```
SORT mylist DESC
```

When `mylist` contains string values and you want to sort them
lexicographically, use the `!ALPHA` modifier:

```
SORT mylist ALPHA
```

The number of returned elements can be limited using the `!LIMIT` modifier.
This modifier takes the `offset` argument, specifying the number of elements to
skip and the `count` argument, specifying the number of elements to return from
starting at `offset`.
The following example will return 10 elements of the sorted version of `mylist`,
starting at element 0 (`offset` is zero-based):

```
SORT mylist LIMIT 0 10
```

Almost all modifiers can be used together.
The following example will return the first 5 elements, lexicographically sorted
in descending order:

```
SORT mylist LIMIT 0 5 ALPHA DESC
```

## Return
