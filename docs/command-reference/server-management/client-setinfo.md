## Syntax

    CLIENT SETINFO <LIB-NAME libname | LIB-VER libver>

**Time complexity:** O(1)

**ACL categories:** @slow, @connection

The `CLIENT SETINFO` command assigns various info attributes to the current connection which are displayed in the output of [`CLIENT LIST`](./client-list.md) and `CLIENT INFO`.

Currently the supported attributes are:

- `lib-name`: The name of the client library that's in use.
- `lib-ver`: The client library's version.

## Return

[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/protocol-spec/#simple-strings): `OK` if the attribute name was successfully set.
