# MONITOR

## Syntax

    MONITOR 

**Time complexity:** undefined

`MONITOR` is a debugging command that streams back every command processed by
the Dragonfly server.
It can help in understanding what is happening to the database.
This command can both be used via `redis-cli` and via `telnet`.

The ability to see all the requests processed by the server is useful in order
to spot bugs in an application both when using Dragonfly as a database and as a
distributed caching system.

```
$ redis-cli monitor
1339518083.107412 [0 127.0.0.1:60866] "keys" "*"
1339518087.877697 [0 127.0.0.1:60866] "dbsize"
1339518090.420270 [0 127.0.0.1:60866] "set" "x" "6"
1339518096.506257 [0 127.0.0.1:60866] "get" "x"
1339518099.363765 [0 127.0.0.1:60866] "eval" "return redis.call('set','x','7')" "0"
1339518100.363799 [0 lua] "set" "x" "7"
1339518100.544926 [0 127.0.0.1:60866] "del" "x"
```

Use `SIGINT` (Ctrl-C) to stop a `MONITOR` stream running via `redis-cli`.

```
$ telnet localhost 6379
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

QUIT

```

Manually issue the `QUIT` or `RESET` commands to stop a `MONITOR` stream running
via `telnet`.

## Commands not logged by MONITOR

Because of security concerns, no administrative commands are logged
by `MONITOR`'s output and sensitive data is redacted in the command `AUTH`.

Furthermore, the command `QUIT` is also not logged.

## Cost of running MONITOR

Because `MONITOR` streams back **all** commands, its use comes at a cost.

## Return

**Non standard return value**, just dumps the received commands in an infinite
flow.
