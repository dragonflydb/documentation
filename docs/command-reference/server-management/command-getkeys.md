# COMMAND GETKEYS

## Syntax

    COMMAND GETKEYS command [arg [arg ...]]

**Time complexity:** O(N) where N is the number of arguments to the command

Returns [Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays) of keys from a full Redis command.

`COMMAND GETKEYS` is a helper command to let you find the keys
from a full Redis command.

`COMMAND` provides information on how to find the key names of each command (see `firstkey`, [key specifications](https://redis.io/topics/key-specs#logical-operation-flags), and `movablekeys`),
but in some cases it's not possible to find keys of certain commands and then the entire command must be parsed to discover some / all key names.
You can use `COMMAND GETKEYS` or `COMMAND GETKEYSANDFLAGS` to discover key names directly from how Redis parses the commands.


## Return

[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): list of keys from your command.

## Examples

```shell
dragonfly> COMMAND GETKEYS MSET a b c d e f
1) "a"
2) "c"
3) "e"
dragonfly> COMMAND GETKEYS EVAL "not consulted" 3 key1 key2 key3 arg1 arg2 arg3 argN
1) "key1"
2) "key2"
3) "key3"
dragonfly> COMMAND GETKEYS SORT mylist ALPHA STORE outlist
1) "mylist"
2) "outlist"
```
