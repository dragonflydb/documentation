# FT.DROPINDEX

## Syntax

    FT.DROPINDEX index [DD]

**Time complexity:** O(1) or O(N) if `DD` is used, where N is the number of documents in the index.

## Description

Delete an index.

By default, `FT.DROPINDEX` only removes the index definition and associated metadata while keeping the actual documents (HASH or JSON keys) intact.

## Required arguments

<details open>
<summary><code>index</code></summary>

is index name. You must first create the index using [`FT.CREATE`](./ft.create.md).
</details>

## Optional arguments

<a name="DD"></a>
<details open>
<summary><code>DD</code></summary>

If set, the operation will delete the actual documents (HASH or JSON keys) that were indexed, in addition to dropping the index itself.

Without this option, only the index structure is removed while all the indexed documents remain in the database.

:::warning
Using `DD` will permanently delete all documents that were indexed. This operation cannot be undone.
