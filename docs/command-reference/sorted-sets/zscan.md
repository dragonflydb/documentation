# ZSCAN

<PageTitle title="Redis ZSCAN Explained (Better Than Official Docs)" />

## Introduction

In Dragonfly, as well as in Redis and Valkey, the `ZSCAN` command is used to incrementally iterate over the members of a sorted set along with their scores.
This is particularly useful when working with large sorted sets to avoid blocking operations, allowing you to fetch elements in small chunks.

The `ZSCAN` command provides a cursor-based interface to scan through a sorted set, ensuring that only a limited number of elements are returned with each call while redistributing work over multiple client requests.

## Syntax

```shell
ZSCAN key cursor [MATCH pattern] [COUNT count]
```

- **Time complexity:** O(1) for every call. O(N) for a complete iteration, including enough command calls for the cursor to return back to 0. N is the number of elements inside the collection.
- **ACL categories:** @read, @sortedset, @slow

## Parameter Explanations

- `key`: The key of the sorted set to scan.
- `cursor`: This is an opaque string used to iterate through elements. Initially, it must be `0`, and it is updated by the server during each call.
- `MATCH pattern` (optional): An optional glob-style pattern to filter the elements.
- `COUNT count` (optional): A hint to the server about how many elements should be returned per scan. The actual number returned may be different.

## Return Values

The command returns an array of two elements:

- The first element is the new cursor to be used in the next scan.
- The second element is an array of member-score pairs from the sorted set for this iteration.

## Code Examples

### Basic Example

Scan members from a sorted set using the cursor, starting from `0`:

```shell
dragonfly> ZADD myzset 10 "a" 20 "b" 30 "c"
(integer) 3
dragonfly> ZSCAN myzset 0
1) "0"                   # New cursor (0 means full iteration has completed)
2) 1) "a"                # Member
   2) "10"               # Score
   3) "b"                # Member
   4) "20"               # Score
   5) "c"                # Member
   6) "30"               # Score
```

### Scanning with Pattern Matching

Only scan for members whose names match a certain pattern:

```shell
dragonfly> ZADD myzset 10 "alpha" 20 "beta" 30 "gamma"
(integer) 3
dragonfly> ZSCAN myzset 0 MATCH a*
1) "0"
2) 1) "alpha"
   2) "10"
   3) "gamma"
   4) "30"
```

### Controlling Iteration Size with `COUNT`

Use the `COUNT` option to limit the number of elements returned in each iteration:

```shell
dragonfly> ZADD myzset 10 "a" 20 "b" 30 "c" 40 "d" 50 "e"
(integer) 5
dragonfly> ZSCAN myzset 0 COUNT 2
1) "2"         # Cursor, indicating more elements remain
2) 1) "a"
   2) "10"
   3) "b"
   4) "20"
```

In the next call, use the returned cursor (`2`) to continue scanning:

```shell
dragonfly> ZSCAN myzset 2 COUNT 2
1) "4"         # Cursor, indicating more elements remain
2) 1) "c"
   2) "30"
   3) "d"
   4) "40"
```

### Scanning Continuously Until Data Exhaustion

To fetch all members of a sorted set, the client has to keep scanning with the cursor provided from previous calls:

```shell
CURSOR="0"          # Initialize cursor to 0
while [ "$CURSOR" -ne "0" ]; do
  SCAN_RESULT=$(dragonfly-cli ZSCAN myzset $CURSOR COUNT 2)
  CURSOR=$(echo $SCAN_RESULT | jq .[0])  # Update cursor from server response
  # Process members from SCAN_RESULT
done
```

## Best Practices

- Since `ZSCAN` can return the same element more than once during an iteration (due to the nature of the scan mechanism), client-side deduplication may be required if complete accuracy is necessary.
- Use the `MATCH` and `COUNT` options thoughtfully to optimize performance. Increasing the `COUNT` can reduce the total number of round trips but may return larger datasets to process.

## Common Mistakes

- Misinterpreting the cursor value: When the cursor returned by the server is `0`, it indicates that the scan is complete.
- Expecting precise control over the number of elements returned with `COUNT`. It's a hint to the server, but the result size may vary.

## FAQs

### Why does the `ZSCAN` command sometimes return the same element multiple times?

The incremental nature of the `ZSCAN` command implies that it may return the same element more than once over multiple invocations.
It is recommended to handle deduplication on the client-side if itâ€™s critical to avoid processing duplicate items.

### Is `ZSCAN` blocking?

No, `ZSCAN` is non-blocking and designed for incrementally iterating through large sets.
It spreads work across multiple calls, preventing performance bottlenecks in a single blocking operation.

### Can I use `ZSCAN` to delete elements from a sorted set during iteration?

No, you should not modify a sorted set during a scan.
Modifying the sorted set while scanning may result in incorrect or inconsistent results.
