# ACL LIST

## Syntax

    ACL LIST

**ACL categories:** @admin, @slow, @dangerous

This command returns an array of the different users and their respective ACL rules. Each line
consists of the username, followed by a 15 char preview of the hashed password, their status (ON/OFF) and their rules.

## Return

[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): An array of strings. This command does not explicitly report (like redis) the removed ACL categories. For example, if a user was created in redis with `-@fast`, `ACL LIST` would print that `-@fast` for that given user. We found that this redundancy is a confusing user experience and therfore we decided to not include it in the result string because if for a given user a command category is missing, it's a clear indicator that this user does not have that rule in their ACL list.

## Examples

```shell
dragonfly> ACL LIST
1) "user george on #9f86d081884c7d +@admin +@fast"
2) "user default on nopass +@all"
```
