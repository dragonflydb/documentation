# GETRANGE

## Syntax

    GETRANGE key start end

**Time complexity:** O(N) where N is the length of the returned string. The complexity is ultimately determined by the returned length, but because creating a substring from an existing string is very cheap, it can be considered O(1) for small strings.

Returns the substring of the string value stored at `key`, determined by the
offsets `start` and `end` (both are inclusive).
Negative offsets can be used in order to provide an offset starting from the end
of the string.
So -1 means the last character, -2 the penultimate and so forth.

The function handles out of range requests by limiting the resulting range to
the actual length of the string.
