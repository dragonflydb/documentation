## Overview

Dragonfly Cloud is an in-memory data store service fully managed by the Dragonfly team.

Dragonfly Cloud deploys [Dragonfly](https://github.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly) instances (the exact same
technology without gated features), providing full API compatibility
with [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis), [Valkey](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey),
and [Memcached](https://github.com/memcached/memcached).

Hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure, Dragonfly Cloud is designed
to be cost-efficient, highly available, secure, and simple to operate.
