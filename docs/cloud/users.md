# Manage Users

Dragonfly Cloud adopts a role-based access control (RBAC) model to manage users.

The following roles are available:
1. **User**: Full access to all resources. Can create, view, update, and delete data stores, networks, payment methods etc.
2. **Owner**: Same as User, but can also add and remove users and change the role of a user.
3. **Viewer**: Read-only access to all resources.

To view and manage user go to the Dragonfly Cloud account in the *Account > Users* tab.

An *Owner* can add a user by clicking the **+ User** button.  
Enter the new userâ€™s first name, last name, email address and select a role.

Once added the new user will be able to login to your Dragonfly Cloud account.

An *Owner* can delete an existing user or modify its role under the three dots menu (<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24px" viewBox="0 -960 960 960" width="24px" fill="#e8eaed"><path d="M480-160q-33 0-56.5-23.5T400-240q0-33 23.5-56.5T480-320q33 0 56.5 23.5T560-240q0 33-23.5 56.5T480-160Zm0-240q-33 0-56.5-23.5T400-480q0-33 23.5-56.5T480-560q33 0 56.5 23.5T560-480q0 33-23.5 56.5T480-400Zm0-240q-33 0-56.5-23.5T400-720q0-33 23.5-56.5T480-800q33 0 56.5 23.5T560-720q0 33-23.5 56.5T480-640Z"/></svg>) on the right side of the user row.
