# Backups on Dragonfly cloud
Dragonfly Cloud offers automated backups for data protection and restoration.  However, backups **are not enabled by default**. When creating a data store, you can enable backups and configure the retention period.


## Enabling Backups

1. During the data store creation process, check the "Enable Backups" option.
