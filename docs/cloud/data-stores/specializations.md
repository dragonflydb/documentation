# Specializations

Dragonfly Cloud offers specializations that allow you to enable additional features and integrations for your data store with just a few clicks.


## BullMQ 
Enable this for running BullMQ workloads, this requires you to apply redis cluster curly braces syntax for the queue names as described <a href="https://www.dragonflydb.io/docs/integrations/bullmq#2-queue-naming-strategies"> here</a>

If that is not possible please contact support.
