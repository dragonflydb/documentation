# Specializations

Dragonfly Cloud offers specializations that allow you to enable additional features and integrations for your data store with just a few clicks.


## BullMQ Integration

<a href="https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq">BullMQ</a> is a Node.js library that provides a fast and robust queue system built on top of Redis. It helps in resolving modern-age architectures of microservices by enabling efficient task queuing and processing.

With Dragonfly Cloud, you can enable the BullMQ integration for your data store during the creation process. By selecting the BullMQ specialization, you can integrate BullMQ with your data store without any additional setup or configuration.

To enable the BullMQ specialization, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the <a href="https://dragonflydb.cloud/datastores/new"> Create Data Store </a> page.


2. In the "Specializations" section, check the box for "BullMQ."
