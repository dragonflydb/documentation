# Data Retention

## Data Stores

- Data written into a Dragonfly Cloud data store is only stored in memory by default.
- All data is deleted when the data store is deleted.

## Backups

- You can specify a retention period for [backups](backups.md).
- All data is deleted when the retention period of a backup expires.
- All data is deleted when [a backup is deleted manually](backups#viewing-and-deleting-backups) by a user.

## Dragonfly Cloud Operations

- If the Dragonfly Cloud operations team takes a backup of a data store, the backup is deleted as soon as possible and is never retained for more than 60 days.
- For details regarding the processing of Dragonfly Cloud users' data, please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.dragonflydb.io/privacy).
