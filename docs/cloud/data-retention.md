# Data Retention

Data written into a Dragonfly Cloud data store is only stored in memory by default.
All data is deleted when the data store is deleted.

Customers can specify retention period for backups.
All data is deleted when the retention period expires.

In case Dragonfly Cloud operations team takes a backup of the data store, it is deleted as soon as possible and is not retained for more than 90 in any case.
