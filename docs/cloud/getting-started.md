# Getting Started

Getting started with *Dragonfly Cloud* is easy. You can have your first *data store* up and running in minutes.

All you have to do is navigate to [dragonflydb.cloud](https://dragonflydb.cloud) and sign up for an account.

To complete the sign up process you will be required to pick a name for your *organization*.
You can later [add more users](./users.md) to your *organization*.

After signing up you will land on the *Data Stores* page, where you can create your first *data store* by clicking the [+Data Store](https://dragonflydb.cloud/datastores/new) button.  
You only need to pick a *name*, a *cloud provider* and *cloud region*.  
For more configuration options see [Data Stores](./datastores).

Before creating your first *data store* you will be asked to add *payment card*.
You can track usage and costs under the *Account > Usage* tab.

You are only charged while the *data store* is active, prorated to the hour, and you can delete the data store at any time.
 
We offer an unlimited 3GB Development plan for around $35/month (less than $0.05 an hour), depending on the cloud provider and region, as an easy way to get started.

***Happy building with Dragonfly Cloud!***
