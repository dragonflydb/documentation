# Getting Started

Getting started with [Dragonfly Cloud](https://dragonflydb.cloud) is easy.
You can **have your first in-memory data store up and running in minutes**.
Note that Dragonfly Cloud is powered by the exact same technology as
the [Dragonfly project](https://github.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly), the most performant in-memory data store on earth,
as there are no gated features.
Dragonfly Cloud drastically simplifies the deployment, management, and operation of your Dragonfly data stores.

## Creating an Account

- All you have to do is navigate to [Dragonfly Cloud](https://dragonflydb.cloud) and sign up for an account.
- To complete the sign-up process, you will be required to pick a name for your **Organization**.
- You can later [add more users](./managing-users.md) to your organization and manage their permissions.

## Creating Your First Data Store

- After signing up, you will land on the [Data Stores](https://dragonflydb.cloud/datastores) page.
- You can create your first data store by clicking the [+Data Store](https://dragonflydb.cloud/datastores/new) button.
- You only need to pick a **Name**, a **Cloud Provider**, and a **Cloud Region** for your data store.
- For more configuration options, see detailed documentation on [data stores](./data-stores.md).

## Payment & Development Instances

- Before creating your first data store, you will be asked to add a **Payment Credit Card**.
- You can track usage and costs under the [Account > Usage](https://dragonflydb.cloud/account/usage) tab.
- You are only charged while the data store is active, prorated to the hour.
- You can delete a data store at any time to stop incurring charges.
- We offer unlimited 3GB development instances for around **$36/month (less than $0.05/hour)** in popular regions.
- Depending on cloud providers & regions, the cost can vary. But a development instance is the easiest way to get started.

**Happy building with Dragonfly Cloud!**
