# Getting Started

Getting started with [**Dragonfly Cloud**](https://dragonflydb.cloud) is easy.
You can **have your first in-memory data store up and running in minutes**.
Note that Dragonfly Cloud is powered by the exact same technology as
the [**Dragonfly project**](https://github.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly), the most performant in-memory data store on earth,
as there are no gated features.
Dragonfly Cloud drastically simplifies the deployment, management, and operation of your Dragonfly data stores.

## Create an Account

- All you have to do is navigate to [Dragonfly Cloud](https://dragonflydb.cloud) and sign up for an account.
- To complete the sign-up process, you will be required to pick a name for your **_organization_**.
- You can later [add more users](./users.md) to your **_organization_** and manage their permissions.

## Create Your First Data Store

- After signing up, you will land on the [Data Stores](https://dragonflydb.cloud/datastores) page.
- You can create your first **_data store_** by clicking the [+Data Store](https://dragonflydb.cloud/datastores/new) button.  
- You only need to pick a **_name_**, a **_cloud provider_**, and a **_cloud region_** for your **_data store_**.
- For more configuration options, see detailed documentation on [data stores](./datastores.md).

## Payment & Development Instances

- Before creating your first **_data store_**, you will be asked to add a **_payment card_**.
- You can track usage and costs under the [Account > Usage](https://dragonflydb.cloud/account/usage) tab.
- You are only charged while the **_data store_** is active, prorated to the hour.
- You can delete a **_data store_** at any time to stop incurring charges.
- We offer unlimited 3GB development instances for around **$35/month (less than $0.05/hour)** in popular regions.
- Depending on cloud providers & regions, the cost can vary. But a development instance is the easiest way to get started.

**Happy building with Dragonfly Cloud!**
