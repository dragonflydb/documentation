# Integrations Overview

## Introduction

Dragonfly is designed from the ground up to provide a seamless, highly efficient, and blazingly fast alternative to Redis.
Our mission is to enhance the performance of projects that rely on in-memory storage without having to compromise on reliability or ease of use.

Being a drop-in replacement for Redis, Dragonfly can be integrated into any project that utilizes Redis as its backend in-memory store.
This means that projects that depend on Redis can easily make the switch to Dragonfly, experiencing superior throughput and hardware efficiency
with zero or minimal effort in terms of code or configuration adjustments.

## Officially Supported Integrations

Despite Dragonfly's promise of a seamless switch, the Dragonfly community invests significant effort into thorough testing and benchmarking.
Our commitment ensures that these projects are not just compatible but are officially supported,
providing users with peace of mind and confidence in the stability and performance enhancements Dragonfly offers.

- [BullMQ](./bullmq.md): A premium job and message queue system for Node.js.
- [ClickHouse](./clickhouse.md): A fast open-source column-oriented DBMS that allows generating analytical data reports in real time.
- [Feast](./feast.md): A customizable feature store for operational machine learning.
- [Sidekiq](./sidekiq.md): Simple and efficient background job processing for Ruby.

## Making the Switch

If you're already using one of the open-source projects with Redis, transitioning to Dragonfly is straightforward.
This section will guide you through the integration process and any nuances or special considerations to keep in mind.

For developers or teams eyeing new ventures or seeking to integrate other existing projects, you'll be pleased to know that Dragonfly compatibility is robust.
This means various projects that leverage Redis can also be configured to use Dragonfly with minimal effort.
We will be adding more integration projects to the officially supported list in the future.
